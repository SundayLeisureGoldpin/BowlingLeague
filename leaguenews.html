                        <h3>27/08/25 - News Update</h3><p>We now have confirmation from the Bowl that their lineage is increasing to £4.00 a game and that we cannot bowl the Sundays directly before the two school half terms start, but instead they have allowed us to bowl two double headers to ensure we finish the season in May 2026.</p>
                        <p>So, in summary:</p>
                        <ul>
                           <li><p>The league will start at 09.25 on Sunday 7 September 2025.</p></li>
                           <li><p>The league will run for 28 weeks (with each team bowling every other team 4 x times and no positional rounds) and finish on the 17 May 2026.</p></li>
                           <li><p>Please note in your diaries the two double headers mentioned, these are on 19 October 2025 and 8 February 2026.</p></li>
                           <li><p>Our lineage will now increase from £15.00 to £16.00 per/bowler to accommodate the Bowls lineage increase.</p></li>
                           <li><p>Of the £16.00 lineage, £4.00 goes towards the prize fund and to cover our other costs, which means a blind bowler now only pays £4.00 instead of £4.20.</p></li>
                           <li><p>A single absent bowler blind score remains 200 and in the case of an absent team, it remains at 190 for each missing bowler (important to note with postponement’s no longer allowed).</p></li>
                           <li><p>To qualify for an individual award, please note also that due to the shortened season, a bowler will now need to bowl a minimum of only 9 matches.</p></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Please read Constitution Rules 10, 11, 12, 16 and 17, amended to accommodate all this coming season’s changes.</p>
                        <p>See you all on the 7 September</p>

                        <h3>20/08/25 - News Update</h3><p>The AGM for the forthcoming season was held at 7.30pm at The North Star, 271 Hook Road, Chessington KT9 1EQ, on the 18 August 2025. You can read the minutes of the meeting in full by clicking <a href="agmminutes.html"><b>here</b></a>, however, below is a summary of the salient points that came from the meeting:</p>
                        <ul>
                           <li><p>Our league accounts show we have a very healthy bank balance of exactly £865.98, which will be carried over
to the 2025-2026 season.</p></li>
                           <li><p>We understand that at present the Bowl has not increased the cost of each league game and it remains at &pound;3.60 (&pound;10.80 per match), at this time we are therefore keeping our lineage at &pound;15.00.</p></li>
                           <li><p>Both the Secretary and the Treasurers fees have been increased by &pound;50.00, making them &pound;200.00 and &pound;150.00 respectively.</p></li>
                           <li><p>The league will start at 09.25 on 7 September 2025, however, we cannot publish a schedule as there are still ongoing discussions with the Bowl regarding the Sundays we can and cannot bowl. However, it is likely to be either a 24 or 28 week season, but we will keep you informed.</p></li>
                           <li><p>To be eligible for any league individual award a member must bowl in at least 1/3 of our league matches. This will be rounded down if the number of matches is not wholly divisible by 3 (e.g. in a season with 28 matches, a bowler must bowl in 9).</p></li>
                           <li><p>If applicable in the future, the last positional round of the season will always have the league's first place team on lane 32, with the remaining lanes determined by league position. Any positional matches mid-season will have pairs of lanes randomly selected.</p></li>
                           <li><p>The "Most Improved Average" will now be based on the bowler's average from the previous season and not the first 3 matches (unless there is a new bowler).</p></li>  
                           <li><p>There will no longer be a trophy or prize money for the "High Individual Match Points", this will be replaced with a new individual knockout, which will run alongside the existing singles knockout.</p></li>
                           <li><p>The league no longer accepts postponements, if a team cannot field at least one bowler for a scheduled match, a team blind is to be used. It is important to read Rule 11 of the Constitution for clarification.</p></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Our league constitution has been amended to reflect the above, but otherwise it remains the same as the previous season.</p>
                        <p>All that is now left for me to say is that we look forward to seeing you all again for yet another great season, in what must be one of the oldest, if not the oldest league's still running at Tolworth, on <b>Sunday 7 September 2025</b> at 9.25am.</p>
