                        <h3>22/09/25 - Week 03</h3><p>So far it's been a topsy turvy season for results, which means that no team now has a 100% win record, including top of the league Gutter Humiliation who lost 9-15 to Destroyers. Back up into 2nd place are Goofballs, who with 42 points are 5 point behind Gutter Humiliation following their 22-2 win against Grumpy Old Men. Also on 42 points, but 3rd in the table on total pinfall are Jokers Wild, after they beat Crazy Monkeys 22-2 (Jokers Wild were bottom of the table with just 4 points after the first week). Crazy Monkeys loss this week drops them to 8th place on 22 points, 8 points behind Orient Express in 7th spot following their draw with Mainstream.</p>
                        <p>Just looking at the top places in the high game/series tables (as it is very early in the season), the only change we have is Ethan Plant of Orient Express, he takes 1st place in the mens scratch high game table with a 269.</p>
                        <p>The first matches in the team knockout were bowled this week and we also have the seeded draw for the singles knockout, so check the result pages for these and all the other results.</p>      
                        <h3>18/09/25 - Week 02</h3><p>We already only have two unbeaten teams in the league, they are Gutter Humiliation in 1st place on 38 points after they beat Goofballs 24-0 and in 2nd place, Grumpy Old Men with 36 points following their 22-2 win against Crazy Monkeys. With 22 points and in 3rd place are Destroyers, who drew their match against Mainstream. That draw keeps Mainstream down in 7th place on 18 points with total pinfall putting them just ahead of Orient Express in 8th place, who lost 8-16 to Jokers Wild.</p>
                        <p>Gutter Humiliation now make it a clean sweep of the team high game/series tables by this week also topping the team high handicap series table with 1500. Gutter Humiliation's Kevin Hazelgrove does the same as his team, topping all the tables after taking 1st place in the mens handicap series table with 772.</p>
                        <p>This week was the start of the Individual League, the tables can be found as always on the result pages.</p>
                        <p>Please note that despite my best efforts, there is still loading issues with all the results pdf files, please click on and off the desired page if it does not load first time, it will load eventually.</p>       
                        <h3>10/09/25 - Week 01</h3><p>A good start to the season for Goofballs with a 20-4 win over Jokers Wild, meaning Goofballs take the top spot after the first match of the 2025-2026 season. In 2nd place are Crazy Monkeys after they beat last season's runners up, Mainstream, 18-6. In third place on total pinfall are Grumpy Old Men, following a 14-10 win in their match against Destroyers. At the other end of the table, that defeat by Crazy Monkeys means Mainstream are 7th on 6 points and with 4 points, we have Jokers Wild in 8th place.</p>
                        <p>It's early days, so just a quick summary of the handicap high game/series tables. Gutter Humiliation are top of the team handicap high game table with a 529 and a 1391, takes Grumpy Old Men to the top of the team high series table. Noteable individual performances include, for the men, Kevin Hazelgrove's top of the table 271 high handicap game and Phil Meears who is top of the handicap high series table with a 723. For the ladies, Jackie Relph is top of the handicap high game and series table with a 234 and 674 respectively.</p>
                        <p>Undoubtedly with 27 more weeks to go, there will be many changes to all these tables, so watch this space.</p>                           
                        <h3>27/08/25 - News Update</h3><p>We now have confirmation from the Bowl that their lineage is increasing to £4.00 a game and that we cannot bowl the Sundays directly before the two school half terms start, but instead they have allowed us to bowl two double headers to ensure we finish the season in May 2026.</p>
                        <p>So, in summary:</p>
                        <ul>
                           <li><p>The league will start at 09.25 on Sunday 7 September 2025.</p></li>
                           <li><p>The league will run for 28 weeks (with each team bowling every other team 4 x times and no positional rounds) and finish on the 17 May 2026.</p></li>
                           <li><p>Please note in your diaries the two double headers mentioned, these are on 19 October 2025 and 8 February 2026.</p></li>
                           <li><p>Our lineage will now increase from £15.00 to £16.00 per/bowler to accommodate the Bowls lineage increase.</p></li>
                           <li><p>Of the £16.00 lineage, £4.00 goes towards the prize fund and to cover our other costs, which means a blind bowler now only pays £4.00 instead of £4.20.</p></li>
                           <li><p>A single absent bowler blind score remains 200 and in the case of an absent team, it remains at 190 for each missing bowler (important to note with postponement’s no longer allowed).</p></li>
                           <li><p>To qualify for an individual award, please note also that due to the shortened season, a bowler will now need to bowl a minimum of only 9 matches.</p></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Please read Constitution Rules 10, 11, 12, 16 and 17, amended to accommodate all this coming season’s changes.</p>
                        <p>See you all on the 7 September</p>

                        <h3>20/08/25 - News Update</h3><p>The AGM for the forthcoming season was held at 7.30pm at The North Star, 271 Hook Road, Chessington KT9 1EQ, on the 18 August 2025. You can read the minutes of the meeting in full by clicking <a href="agmminutes.html"><b>here</b></a>, however, below is a summary of the salient points that came from the meeting:</p>
                        <ul>
                           <li><p>Our league accounts show we have a very healthy bank balance of exactly £865.98, which will be carried over
to the 2025-2026 season.</p></li>
                           <li><p>We understand that at present the Bowl has not increased the cost of each league game and it remains at &pound;3.60 (&pound;10.80 per match), at this time we are therefore keeping our lineage at &pound;15.00.</p></li>
                           <li><p>Both the Secretary and the Treasurers fees have been increased by &pound;50.00, making them &pound;200.00 and &pound;150.00 respectively.</p></li>
                           <li><p>The league will start at 09.25 on 7 September 2025, however, we cannot publish a schedule as there are still ongoing discussions with the Bowl regarding the Sundays we can and cannot bowl. However, it is likely to be either a 24 or 28 week season, but we will keep you informed.</p></li>
                           <li><p>To be eligible for any league individual award a member must bowl in at least 1/3 of our league matches. This will be rounded down if the number of matches is not wholly divisible by 3 (e.g. in a season with 28 matches, a bowler must bowl in 9).</p></li>
                           <li><p>If applicable in the future, the last positional round of the season will always have the league's first place team on lane 32, with the remaining lanes determined by league position. Any positional matches mid-season will have pairs of lanes randomly selected.</p></li>
                           <li><p>The "Most Improved Average" will now be based on the bowler's average from the previous season and not the first 3 matches (unless there is a new bowler).</p></li>  
                           <li><p>There will no longer be a trophy or prize money for the "High Individual Match Points", this will be replaced with a new individual knockout, which will run alongside the existing singles knockout.</p></li>
                           <li><p>The league no longer accepts postponements, if a team cannot field at least one bowler for a scheduled match, a team blind is to be used. It is important to read Rule 11 of the Constitution for clarification.</p></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Our league constitution has been amended to reflect the above, but otherwise it remains the same as the previous season.</p>
                        <p>All that is now left for me to say is that we look forward to seeing you all again for yet another great season, in what must be one of the oldest, if not the oldest league's still running at Tolworth, on <b>Sunday 7 September 2025</b> at 9.25am.</p>
