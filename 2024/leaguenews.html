                        <h3>18/06/2025 - News Update</h3><p>We can confirm that the awards for the Sunday Leisure Goldpin 2024-2025 season and the 2025-2026 AGM will be on the 18th August 2025 at the The North Star, 271 Hook Road, Chessington.  Please make sure there is at least one representative of your team there (for voting purposes) ready for the proceedings to start at 7.30 pm.</p> 
                        <h3>04/06/25 - Week 30</h3><p>Well that's yet another season over and after this week's positional matches, we find there is not a single positional change to the league table.  Gutter Humiliation are of course top and ended up with a 65 point lead over 2nd placed Maintream, who have 401 points after Gutter Humiliation beat them 16-8.  This was the 6th time Gutter Humiliation have bowled against Mainstream this season, Gutter Humiliation have won four of the matches, drawn one and lost one, results that meant they took a massive 97 points from Mainstream alone (that's over a fifth of their total of 466).  Despite losing 0-24 to Goofballs, Orient Express just hold onto 3rd place with 379 points (5 points more than 4th placed Goofballs), which makes their Adrian Chen's 16-8 win against Gutter Humiliation last week even more impressive. The match at the bottom end of the table between Crazy Monkeys and Jokers Wild ended up as a draw, meaning Crazy Monkeys remain in 9th place with 309 points and Jokers Wild stay 10th with 305 points and win this season's Wooden Spoon.</p>
                        <p>The very last matches of the season brought some important changes to the high game/series tables.  Kevin Hazelgrove of Gutter Humiliation waited until this week to bowl his best scratch series of 749, which gives him 2nd place in that men's table. He also takes 3rd place in the handicap high series table from Mainstream's Mark Woodman with a score of 791. Splits Happen's Cara Hallsworth also waited until this last week to secure the ladies handicap high game table top spot with a 263, which previously she had held jointly with Mainstream's Diana Woodman.</p>    
                        <p>As usual you can find all the results in detail by going to the result pages, but in summary here are our 2024-2025 season league and knockout competition winners and runners-up, congratulations to you all:</p>

All being well our 2025-2026 season should then start on Sunday 7th September 2025, but again, watch this space as this could all change over the summer.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time everyone, have a great summer and we will see you all again in no time at all at the AGM.</p>
                        <h3>28/05/25 - News Update</h3><p>Don't forget it is our end of season raffle (in lieu of the postponed Easter Raffle) this coming Sunday to raise funds for our league, so please be kind enough to each donate a raffle prize and in addition, bring some additional cash with you to purchase some raffle tickets.  Thank you very much in advance for your support.</p>  
                        <h3>28/05/25 - Week 29</h3><p>The penultimate week of the season gave us a big surprise with our league champions, Gutter Humiliation, losing to Adrian Chen of Orient Express, who bowled on his own and won his team 16 points.  Mainstream, who have held the 2nd spot now for 20 of our 29 weeks, have 393 points after winning their match against Invaders 14-10. With that win over Gutter Humiliation, Orient Express are only 14 points behind Mainstream in 3rd place and with the final positional matches to come, are taking the fight for the league's runners-up position to the last match of the season. Crazy Monkeys remain in 9th place on 297 points despite gaining a valuable 10 points in their match against Grumpy Old Men. Jokers Wild drop down to the foot of the table following a 0-24 defeat by Destroyers, but they are only 4 points behind Crazy Monkeys, so have every chance of moving up from the bottom of the table.</p>
                        <p>There were no changes to the high game/series tables again this week, with one week to go, this coming Sunday is the last chance for you to register a season's top three score.</p>
                        <h3>19/05/25 - Week 28</h3><p>Well that's it, we now know the 2024/2025 Sunday Leisure Goldpin Tem Pin Bowling League champions.  With only 48 points left to play for and a 63 point lead over the 2nd placed team, our congratulations must go to Gutter Humiliation, who clinched the title with a 24-0 win over Crazy Monkeys. With only one win in the last 7 matches, their latest defeat being 11-13 by Orient Express, amazingly Mainstream hang on to their 2nd place with 379 points. That win means that with 363 points, Orient Express remain in the league's 3rd spot. The big defeat by Gutter Humiliation drops Crazy Monkeys, who are still on 287 points, down to 9th place.  Splits Happen find themselves back at the foot of he table after losing 4-12 to Destroyers, but are just 2 points behind Crazy Monkeys.</p>
                        <p>There were no changes to the high game/series tables this week, but the first of the three singles knockout matches were bowled, check out this and all the results by clicking Results in the top menu,</p>
                        <p>Do not forget there is bowling on Sunday this coming Bank Holiday weekend and also, please note there will be an end of season raffle this year on the 1 June 2025 (as we were unable to hold it at Easter), so please support the league by remembering to bring prize donations and spare cash for raffle tickets. Thank you.</p>   
                        <h3>14/05/25 - Week 27</h3><p>With just three more weeks to go, Gutter Humiliation find themselves 50 points clear of the 2nd placed team following their 14-10 win at Invaders expense. Mainstream get their first win in 6 weeks, a 14-10 victory over Destroyers and with 368 points, still hold on to their 2nd place. A 17-7 win for Orient Express against Crazy Monkeys, means that with 350 points Orient Express keep their 3rd place. Joker's Wild done themselves a big favour Sunday in their endeavour to avoid the wooden spoon, they beat Splits Happen 22-2 and although the positions at the foot of the table remain unchanged, with Splits Happen 9th on 281 points, Joker's Wild are now just 11 points away from moving above them in the table.</p>
                        <p>Although they lost, Invaders bowled well, they are now 2nd in the team scratch game table and 1st in the team handicap table with 476 and 556 respectively.</p>
                        <p>Another round in the team knockout was bowled Sunday, check the Result pages for these and all the other results.</p>
                        <h3>02/05/25 - Week 26</h3><p>Top of the table Gutter Humiliation's total of 404 points for the season looks like a browser's "Page Not Found" error code, however, there is no error in their quest for the title after picking up 27 points this week from their two matches against Mainstream and Goofballs. Mainstream, who were just a few pins away from a good win against Gutter Humiliation but ended up only drawing, hang on to their 2nd place for another week with 354 points.  Up into 3rd place on 333 points are Orient Express, following their big 22-2 win over Jokers Wild. That defeat, their first in five weeks, leaves Jokers Wild on 249 points and keeps them at the foot of the table for the 12th consequetive week. Splits Happen with 279 points drop back down into 9th place, after losing 8-16 to Grumpy Old Men.</p>
                        <p>There were no changes to the high game/series tables again this week.</p>
                        <p>Don't forget that with it being a Bank Holiday weekend, there is no bowling this coming Sunday, therefore we will see you all again on 11th May.</p>      
                        <h3>10/04/25 - Week 25</h3><p>There was no match this week for Gutter Humiliation who were scheduled to bowl Goofballs, something both teams will be pleased with given the lane conditions.  Anyway, with the lead Gutter Humiliation had, even without bowling they remain firmly at the top of the league table.  Unfortunately for them, Mainstream did bowl and lost 4-20 against Splits Happen, which is Mainstream's fourth defeat in a row (their 5th from the last six matches) and leaves them on 342 points in 2nd place. Not bowling means Goofballs lost the opportunty to close the gap on Mainstream, but instead remain in 3rd place. Crazy Monkeys in 9th place had a good win beating Destroyers 19-5, giving Crazy Monkeys 266 points. Jokers Wild in 10th place and now with 247 points won yet again, they picked up 15 points from Invaders.</p>
                        <p>There were no changes to the high game/series tables, not a surprise with so many bowlers not able to bowl their best on undressed lanes. We do have the first matches in the team knockout final though, which can be found on the result pages.</p>
                        <p>Remember there is no bowling now until Sunday 27 April due to the school holidays and the Bank Holiday, so we will see you all again then, but in the mean time have a great Easter.</p>
                        <h3>31/03/2025 - News Update</h3><p>Please note that due to the number of postponed matches and unusually high volume of blinds being played by teams, for the first time the Easter Raffle is not being held the last Sunday before the holidays, instead the raffle will be held later in the season (watch this space for further news).</p> 
                        <h3>31/03/25 - Week 24</h3><p>Still winning matches and at the top of our league and now with 377 points are Gutter Humiliation, their latest victory being the 14-10 defeat of Grumpy Old Men. Hanging on to 2nd place despite losing their third match in a row (which is their forth loss in five matches) are Mainstream, they lost 10-14 to Jokers Wild, giving Mainstream 338 points for the season. Closing the gap on Mainstream down to just 27 points are 3rd placed Goofballs, after they beat Crazy Monkeys 16-8 in a pre-bowled match. After a long run of defeats, that win over Mainstream is Jokers Wild's third consequtive victory, but with 232 points they remain at the foot of the table. However, now only 15 points ahead are Crazy Monkeys in 9th position, following the above mentioned defeat by Goofballs.</p>
                        <p>There were no changes again to the high game/series tables this week.  However we do now know the single knockout finalists, find out who they are and all the other results in the top menu link.</p>  
                        <h3>27/03/25 - Week 23</h3><p>Top of the league Gutter Humiliation are back in winning ways following their 20-4 win over Destroyers. Mainstream in 2nd place suffered their second defeat in a row, losing 9-15 to Grumpy Old Men, which leaves Mainstream on 328 points and now 35 points behind Gutter Humiliation. Still in 3rd place are Goofballs, who close the gap to Mainstream to 33 points after beating Orient Express 14-10. Crazy Monkeys remain 9th on 239 points and Jokers Wild 10th on 218 points after they bowled each other, a match that saw Jokers Wild winning the contest 15-9.</p>
                        <p>There were no changes to the high game/series tables this week.</p>
                        <p>At the time of writing only the league and merit results have been made available on the result pages (PC problems being the cause), all other results will be posted as soon as possible.</p>   
                        <h3>19/03/25 - Week 22</h3><p>After ten defeats in a row, Jokers Wild get their long awaited change of fortune, a 14-10 win over top of the league Gutter Humiliation. Despite that defeat, Gutter Humiliation extend their lead at the top to 24 points following the 6-18 defeat suffered by Mainstream at the hands of Goofballs, leaving Mainstream in 2nd place on 319 points. That win by Goofballs gives them 281 points and moves them up into 3rd place, their highest position for 12 weeks. No change at the other end of the table.  Splits Happen remain 9th on 222 points following a 10-14 loss to Crazy Monkeys and although they had that great win this week, Jokers Wild are still 10th with 203 points.</p>
                        <p>Mainstream stood no chance with the form Goofballs were in, they consolidate their 2nd place in the team scratch high series table scoring a 1238, a series helped by their William Kwok's 775 scratch series, which extends his lead at the top of that mens table. William also goes top of the mens handicap high series with an 808.</p>
                        <p>You can find all Sundays results using the Results link in the top menu, which includes the first weeks scores in the singles knockout semi-finals.</p> 
                        <h3>11/03/25 - Week 21</h3><p>Top of the league Gutter Humiliation drew this week in their match against Splits Happen, giving Gutter Humiliation 333 points. Now 20 points behind Gutter Humiliation in 2nd place are Mainstream, following Mainstream's 19-5 win over Crazy Monkeys. Orient Express are the in-form team at present, they beat Invaders 19-5, meaning Orient Express in 3rd place have 268 points. That Splits Happens draw with Gutter Humiliation gives Splits Happen 212 points and although they remain in 9th place, it takes them within 4 points of the 8th placed team.  Jokers Wild suffer another defeat, this time 6-18 to Goofballs, which leaves Jokers Wild in 10th place on 189 points and still waiting for their change in fortune.</p>
                        <p>There were no changes to the high game/series table again this week, but we do know the last four teams in the team knockout, these and all the results are now on the result pages.</p>     
                        <h3>05/03/25 - Week 20</h3><p>It was a positional round this last Sunday and 2nd placed Mainstream got their best result against 1st placed Gutter Humiliation for three matches, albeit a 6-18 defeat, giving Gutter Humiliation at the top of the table 321 points and leaving 2nd placed Mainstream on 294.  Orient Express in 3rd place and now on 249 points, closed the gap on Mainstream slightly following their draw with Destroyers. At the other end of the table, Splits Happen drop down into 9th place on 200 points after losing 2-22 to Grumpy Old Men. Unfortuantely for Jokers Wild (who have been missing Mike Churchyard through injury) they lost their 9th match in a row, this time a 4-20 defeat by Crazy Monkeys, keeping Jokers Wild in 10th place on 183 points,</p>
                        <p>There were no changes to the high game/series table this week and only the Individual League competion run, but still check out the result pages for the league and Individual results.</p>   
                        <h3>11/02/25 - News Update</h3><p>The Bowl management have advised we cannot bowl as per our schedule next Sunday, the 16 February. They now wish to leave the Sunday's either side of the school half term free all day for open bowlers. So therefore our next league matches will be on 2 March and the season is extended until the 1 June.</p> 
                        <h3>11/02/25 - Week 19</h3><p>A 7-17 defeat by Orient Express, their first in five weeks, means Gutter Humiliation's lead at the top of the table has now been reduced to 15 points (it was 36 week 12). Mainstream in 2nd place on 288 points, managed to close the gap on Gutter Humiliation with an 18-6 win over Invaders. Up into 3rd place are Orient Express with 237 points, following that win over Gutter Humiliation. No change at the other end of the table, Crazy Monkeys remain 9th, even though they had a 14-10 win against Grumpy Old Men. Jokers Wild are 12 points behind Crazy Monkeys in 10th place on 179, after they lost 4-20 to Destroyers, which is unfortunately their 7th defeat in a row.</p>
                        <p>The only changes the to high game/series tables are in the mens table, Paul Dale has lost the places he won last week as he now cannot meet the qualifying 10 matches/30 games needed to be played.</p>
                        <p>With the final matches in the 3rd round of the singles knockout bowled this week, see who has won through to the semi-finals and all other results on the Result pages.</p>        
                        <h3>05/02/25 - Week 18</h3><p>There is no stopping Gutter Humiliation who had another big 22-2 win, their victims this time were Crazy Monkeys, this result gives Gutter Humimiliation 296 points and moves them 26 points clear of the 2nd placed team. Dropping 2 points on the leaders, despite a 20-4 win against Orient Express, are Mainstream who now have a total of 270 points. Still in 3rd place, but 45 points behind Mainstream, are Invaders after they lost 4-20 to Goofballs. That defeat by Gutter Humiliation drops Crazy Monkeys down into 9th place with 177 points, just 2 points behind them in 10th place are Jokers Wild, who lost 8-16 to Grumpy Old Men.</p>
                        <p>Gutter Humiliation consolidate their top spot in the team high scratch and series tables with a 498 and a 1455 and in the team handicapped high series table, Mainstream take 3rd place with a 1474. Paul Dale, bowling for Gutter Humiliation, sweeps all aside and takes top place in the mens high scratch game and series table with a 290 and a 786, he also goes 2nd in the mens handicapped high series table with a 792 (but will he bowl the qualifying number of games to keep these positions?). One other bowler that enjoyed success this week was Diana Woodman of Mainstream, she take 1st place in the ladies handicapped series table with a 720.</p>
                        <p>The second matches in the 3rd round of the single knockout were bowled Sunday, see these results and all the others on our result pages.</p>                
                        <h3>27/01/25 - Week 17</h3><p>With a 20-4 win over Invaders, Gutter Humiliation have won 64 points from 72 in their last three matches, now with 274 points it is no surprise they are our clear league leaders. However, Mainstream in 2nd place on 250 points did move 4 points closer to the top spot, following a 24-0 win in their match against Destroyers. Despite that defeat by Gutter Humiliation, Invaders with 221 points hang onto their 3rd place in the table. The bottom two positions remain unchanged this week with Grumpy Old Men in 9th place with 173 points, after they lost 6-18 to Goofballs and Jokers Wild in 10th place on 167 points, after they lost to Splits Happen 8-16.</p>
                        <p>No change to positions in the high game/series tables this week, but William Kwok did consolidate his 1st place in the mens scratch high series table, increasing his series from 712 to 725.</p>
                        <p>On Sunday we had the first matches in the 3rd round of the singles knockout, check out these results and all the others on the result pages.</p>       
                        <h3>22/01/25 - Week 16</h3><p>Extending their league at the top of the table are in form Gutter Humiliation who beat 2nd place Mainstream 20-4, giving Gutter Humiliation 254 points and leaving Mainstream 28 points behind them.

In 9th place this week are Grumpy Old Men with 167 points after they lost to Splits Happen 10-14 and in 10th place are Jokers Wild on 159 points, following their 8-16 defeat by Orient Express.</p>
                        <p>Just two changes to the high game series tables this week. Gutter Humiliation consolidate their top spot in the team scratch high game table with a 494 and Invaders go 3rd in the team scratch high series table with a 1216.</p>
                        <p>The first matches of 2025 in the team knockout were bowled Sunday, don't forget to check out these results and all the others on the result pages.</p>  
                        <h3>16/01/25 - Week 15</h3><p>Welcome to the New Year and in this first week back, those bowling bowled an amazing high scratch average of 172, well done all. Top of the league on 234 points are Gutter Humiliation, who managed a 24-0 win over our current league champions, Goofballs.  However, still remaining 12 points behind Gutter Humiliation in 2nd place are Mainstream, as they also won 24-0 in their match against Splits Happen. Coming back into form and moving up from 4th place to 3rd with 194 points are Invaders, after their 22-2 win over Jokers Wild. Those last two defeats drop Splits Happen down into 9th place on 154 points and Jokers Wild down to 10th place on 151 points, but as mentioned previously, league positions can change so easily with just 19 points between 6th and 10th place.</p>
                        <p>Changes to the high game/series tables this week include Mainstream moving up into 2nd place in the team handicap high game table with 540.  Their Mark Woodman taking 2nd place in the mens scratch high game table with a 270, as well as 1st place in the mens handicap high game table with a 310. In addition, Kevin Hazelgrove of Gutter Humiliation is now 3rd in the mens scratch high series table with a 686.</p>        
                        <h3>16/12/24 - News Update</h3><p>The raffle yesterday was a great success, some &pound102.00 was raised towards the leagues funds.

So who will be starting 2025 at the top of the table, well no surprise there, it is Gutter Humiliation with 210 points after they drew their match against Grumpy Old Men. Still in 2nd place and now only 12 points behind Gutter Humiliation are Mainstream, following their 22-2 win over Jokers Wild. There is no change to Destroyers position in the table either, they remain 3rd with 174 points after they picked up 12 points against their closest revals, Invaders.  At the other end of the table Jokers Wild drop down into 9th place on 149 points after the defeat by Mainstream and Grumpy Old Men are 10th for the second week, even though they grabbed that draw against Gutter Humiliation.</p>
                        <p>There were no changes to the high game/series tables this week.</p>
                        <p>So that's it for 2024, have a fantastic Christmas break and we will see you all again in the New Year when bowling commences on the 12 January 2025.</p>
                        <h3>09/12/24 - News Update</h3><p>Don't forget it is our Christmas Raffle this coming Sunday (15th December) to raise funds for our league, so please be kind enough to each donate a raffle prize and in addition, bring some additional cash with you to purchase the raffle tickets.  Thank you very much in advance for your support.</p>  
                        <h3>09/12/24 - Week 13</h3><p>Gutter Humiliation's lead at the top of the table was reduced this week to 22 points after losing 8-16 to Destroyers, this is Gutter Humiliation's first defeat since Week 6. Remaining in 2nd place for at least one more week are Mainstream on 176 points, following their 22-2 win over Grumpy Old Men. Destroyers keep their 3rd place with 162 points after that win over Gutter Humiliation. Crazy Monkeys beat Jokers Wild 15-9, which with 140 points lifts Crazy Monkeys up into 9th place. That loss to Mainstream means Grumpy Old Men now find themselves at the foot of the table on 135 points.</p>
                        <p>Only Mark Woodman of Mainstream caused any changes to the high game/series table this week, he takes 3rd place in the mens handicap series table with a 785.</p>
                        <p>On the result pages this week we have the latest results in the team knockout competition, so don't forget to check how your team is doing together with all the other bowling results.</p>
                        <h3>05/12/24 - Week 12</h3><p>Gutter humiliation continue their winning streak at the top of the table, they are now 36 points ahead of the 2nd placed team following their 18-6 win over Jokers Wild. Up into 2nd place on 154 points are Mainstream, thanks to a surprise 20-4 win against Goofballs, who seem to have suddenly hit a poor run of form again. Down a place to 3rd are Destroyers on 146 points after they lost 2-22 to Orient Express. That defeat by Mainstream drops Goofballs down to 9th place with 132 points, just 7 points ahead of Crazey Monkeys at the foot of the table, who narrowly lost 11-13 to Splits Happen.</p>
                        <p>With only 29 points seperating the 2nd and 10th place teams this has to be one of the closest seasons we have had, so there is everything to play for with a little over a third of the season bowled.</p>
                        <p>Two bowlers make it onto the high game/series tables this week, they are Kevin Hazelgrove who is 3rd in the mens scratch high game table with a 257 and Steve Deal, who takes 3rd place in the mens handicap high game table with a 294.</p>
                        <p>On the result pages this week we have the qualifiers for the 3rd round of the singles knockout, so don't forget to check this and all the other results there.</p>
                        <h3>27/11/24 - Week 11</h3><p>Tricky lane conditions again this week, but that didn't stop Gutter Humiliation winning their match against a full strength Splits Happen (they've had to play a blind for the last three weeks), which means Gutter Humiliation remain at the top of the table on 172 points.  Up into 2nd place with 144 points, following their 18-6 win over Grumpy Old Men, are Destroyers. Even though they lost 10-14 to Crazy Monkeys, Mainstream find themselves up into 3rd place with 134 points. That defeat for Grumpy Old Men drops them down to 9th in the league with 118 points. At the foot of the table, but now just 4 points away from 9th place are Crazy Monkeys, after that win against Mainstream.</p>
                        <p>Diana Woodman was the bowler on form this week in the high game/series tables, she takes 3rd place in the ladies scratch high game, joint 1st place in the ladies handicap high game and 3rd place in the ladies handicap high series tables with a 180, 262 and 683 respectively.</p>
                        <p>The second matches in the 2nd round of the singles knockout were bowled Sunday, check this and the other results in the results link in the top menu.</p>    
                        <h3>18/11/24 - Week 10</h3><p>It was a positional round this week and top of the table Gutter Humiliation showed their class in overcoming tricky lane conditions by thrashing Mainstream 22-2, giving Gutter Humiliation a total of 158 points. This result means Gutter Humiliation have averaged almost 21 points a match over the last four weeks, whomever bowls them next week could have a mighty challenge on their hands. Another team racing up the table after gaining 62 points from the last three matches are Goofballs, they are now 2nd (but only on total pinfall) on 126 points, after beating Splits Happen 20-4. Up into 3rd place with the same points as Goofballs are Destroyers, they also won big, they defeated Splits Happen 20-4.  No changes at the other end of the table.  Although they won their match against Invaders 16-8, Crazy Monkeys remain 10th on 100 points and Invaders remain 9th on 107 points.</p>
                        <p>With so much oil on the lanes, it's no surprise there were no changes to the high game/series tables this week, but the second round of the singles knockout has started, the results so far (along with our other competitions) can be found on the result pages.</p>  
                        <h3>11/11/24 - Week 09</h3><p>Gutter Humiliation have picked up 61 points in their last three matches, so it's no wonder they are top of our league with a total of 136 points, 21 of them won this week against Orient Express. Up into 2nd place on 122 points are Mainstream, after they beat Invaders 18-6, who in contrast to Gutter Humiliation have surprisingly only picked up 14 points in their last three matches. Splits Happen with 117 points drop down to 3rd place, following their 20-4 defeat by another team coming into form, Goofballs. That defeat by Mainstream leaves Invaders on 99 points, which drops them down to 9th place and remember, Invaders were our league leaders just four weeks ago. Crazy Monkeys won their match against Grumpy Old Men 14-10, but with 84 points they remain in 10th place. Whatever your team's present league position, you can clearly see this week how a little current form drastically affects your position within it, so keep at it.</p>
                        <p>It is no surprise to find Gutter Humiliation and in particular their Graham Hare have shaken up the high game/series table this week. Gutter Humiliation are now top of the scratch high game table, top of the scratch high series table, joint 3rd in the handicap high game table and 2nd in the handicap high series table with 466, 1333, 526 and 1513 respectively. While Graham moves up to 2nd in the mens scratch high game table with 258, 2nd in the scratch high series table with a 707 and top of handicap high series table with an 803.</p>
                        <h3>06/11/24 - Week 08</h3><p>Gutter Humiliation, who were languishing at the bottom of the table after the first two weeks, are now our 3rd different team to top our league table with 115 points after they beat Crazy Monkeys 22-2. Despite winning 14-10, Splits Happen drop to 2nd place on 113 points. Mainstream stay in the top three with 104 points, even though they lost to Orient Express 10-14. Due to that defeat by Gutter Humiliation, Crazy Monkeys on 70 points drop to 10th place, while Goofballs move off the bottom into 9th place with 86 points, following their 22-2 win over out of form Invaders.</p>
                        <p>Goofballs suddenly hit some good form taking 2nd place in both the the team scratch and handicap high series tables with a 1225 and a 1432. In the main this must have been down to their William Kwok who conolidates his top place in the mens scratch high game table with a 277 and with a 712, his scratch high series first place. he also moves up into 2nd place in the handicap game table with a score of 299.</p>
                        <p>Don't forget to go to the result pages, not only for the current league table results, but also the latest team knockout results.</p>   
                        <h3>23/10/24 - Week 07</h3><p>Well how does this work, last years bottom and second from bottom placed teams in the league are this week 1st and 2nd teams, while at the foot of the table are last season's winners?</p>
                        <p>So, Splits Happen who finished 10th last year are now top of the table with 99 points, following their 14-10 win over Jokers Wild and Mainstream who finished 9th, find themselves in 2nd place on 94 points after beating Destroyers 16-8. In 3rd place are Gutter Humiliation (their highest position so far this season) with 93 points, thanks to an 18-6 win against Invaders.  Goofballs, our current league champions, are bottom of the league following a 6-18 defeat by Grumpy Old Men, a result that leaves Goofballs 4 points behind Crazy Monkeys who are on 68 points, after they lost 4-20 to Orient Express.</p>
                        <p>Just one change to the high game/series tables this last Sunday, Graham Manners of Destroyers moves up to 2nd place in the Mens scratch high game table with a 255.</p>         
                        <h3>16/10/24 - Week 06</h3><p>Still only total pinfall split our top two teams with them both on 85 points, which means for the forth week in a row Invaders are top of the league following their 14-10 win over Crazy Monkeys and Splits Happen are 2nd, after beating Grumpy Old Men 14-10. Mainstream are back up into 3rd place on 78 points, with a a 15-9 win against Gutter Humiliation. It's all change at the other end of the table, with a surprise team in 10th place. Our current league champions, Goofballs, find themselves at the foot of the table on 58 points after loosing 10-14 to Destroyers and Orient Express move up a place into 9th, after beating Jokers Wild 22-2, giving Orient Express 62 points.</p>
                        <p>Mainstream hit a little form this week, as did Orient Express. Mainstream take 2nd place in the team scratch game, team scratch series and team handicap series table with a 452, 1203 and 1425 respectively, they also take 3rd place in the team handicap game table with a 526. While Orient Express move top of the team handicap game table with a 547 and top of the team handicap series table with a 1518. In the mens tables Richard Mootion is now top of the handicap games with a 301 and Adrian Chen is 2nd with a 293. Adrian also takes 2nd place in the handicap series table scoring 769, closely followed by Sam Chen (his Dad) in 3rd place with 749. There were no changes to the ladies tables.</p>
                        <p>We now know the bowlers in the next round of the singles knockout, visit the result pages to find out if you got through.</p> 
                        <h3>07/10/24 - Week 05</h3><p>Despite suffering their first defeat of the season, Invaders with 71 points remain top of the league (albeit only on total pinfall), even though they lost 4-20 to Jokers Wild. Also losing and retaining their position are 2nd placed are Splits Happen, who lost 8-16 to Mainstream, leaving Splits Happen on the same points as Invaders. Still 3rd and now just 1 point behind Invaders and Splits Happen are Jokers Wild, thanks to that win against Invaders. No change at the bottom of the table with neither team bowling this week, meaning Grumpy Old Men are 9th and Orient Express are 10th.</p>
                        <p>The only changes to the high game/series tables this Sunday was in the ladies tables, Jackie Relph moves up to 2nd place in the scratch game, scratch series and handicap game tables with a 189, 508 and a 238 respectively.</p>
                        <p>The second matches in the first round of the singles knockout were bowled this week and of course the indivuals are now in progress, so don't forget to check out the result pages.</p>
                        <p>Well they are here, like it or lump it, string pins have arrived. To me the pin action is so different and there is no doubt the strings can affect what pins are left standing, but I guess it is the same for everyone.</p>  
                        <h3>02/10/24 - Week 04</h3><p>Yet another win for Invaders, this time a 16-8 against Destroyers, which keeps them at the top of the league table with 67 points. Chasing Invaders on 63 points and in 2nd place for the third week in a row are Splits Happen, following their 20-4 win over Orient Express. Up into 3rd place are Jokers Wild after they beat Mainstream 14-10, giving Jokers Wild 50 points. Grumpy Old Men with 41 points drop down to 9th place, after losing 8-16 to Gutter Humiliation. In 10th place on 32 points are Orient Express, following that defeat above by Splits Happen.</p>
                        <p>Goofballs were the team in form this last week, they consolidated their top spot in the team scratch high game and team handicap game with a 460 and a 535 respectively, they also go top of the team handicap series with a 1424. In the men's tables, William Kwok goes top of all the tables with a scratch game of 257, a scratch series of 697, a handicap game of 288 and a handicap series of 790.

Despite that defeat by Invaders, Splits Happen remain in 2nd place with 43 points. With 37 points, Mainstream are still 3rd, even though they lost 11-13 to Grumpy Old Men. Due to them both not bowling this week and therefore being a game behind everybody else, Goofballs and Orient Express find themselves in 9th and 10th place respectively, with Goofballs on 26 points and Orient Express on 22 points.</p>
                        <p>in the high game/series tables Gutter Humiliation extend their scratch series table lead with a 1215, while Destoyers go top of the handicap series table with a 1381.

                        <h3>16/09/24 - Week 02</h3><p>With the lanes dressed this week we suddenly see some high scores being bowled. Invaders made the most of the good conditions beating Grumpy Old Men 16-8, a results that takes them to the top of the table on 36 points. Splits Happen drop down to 2nd place with 34 points after losing 10-14 to Crazy Monkeys. With 26 points, Mainstream remain 3rd after they managed to take 10 points from our league champions, Goofballs. The bottom two positons remain unchanged, despite both teams winning. Orient Express are 9th with 18 points after beating Destroyers 14-10 and Gutter Humiliation in 10th place have 16 points, following their 16-8 win over Jokers Wild.</p>
                        <p>Goofballs and Gutter Humiliation bowl well and share the top spots in the team high game/series tables, but our star bowlers this week are, for the men, Renier van Zyl (Invaders) as he tops the mens high scratch game, handicap game and handicap series tables with a 245, 280 and 728 respectively and Kevin Hazelgrove (Gutter Humiliation), who tops the scratch high series table with a 635. Star bowler for the ladies was our new bowler Irina Rusu (Splits Happen), she tops the ladies high scratch game, scratch series, handicap game and handicap series tables with a 179, 488, 231 and 728, again respectively.</p>
                        <p>The result pages have been updated, you may be especially interested in the latest bowlers to qualify for the singles knockout.</p>
                        <h3>11/09/24 - Week 01</h3><p>Unbeleivable, despite reminding the Bowl several times prior, our first week's bowling was marred for many with undressed lanes, but nevertheless the league season got underway.</p>
</p>
                        <p>The lane conditions were no handicap for the team that took the wooden spoon last season, Splits Happen, they beat last season's runner's up, Gutter Humiliation, 24-0, meaning Splits Happen go straight to the top of the table with a 4 point lead. In 2nd place we have Invaders who won their match against Orient Express 20-4. Mainstream are 4 points behind Invaders in 3rd place, following their 16-8 win against Crazey Monkeys. At the other end of the table in 9th place on 4 points we have Orient Express, following their defeat by Invaders and Gutter Humiliation in 10th place, with no points after that result against Splits Happen.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the high games and series tables, only two players coped with the lane conditions and they were Mainstream's James Woodman for the men and Destroyer's Jackie Relph for the ladies, both top all the tables but of particular note is James, who managed a 242 scratch game and a 590 scratch series.</p>
                        <p>Finally, although all our inter-league competitions do not starting until Week 4, you do need to qualify for the singles knockout. Posted on the singles knockout result page are the bowlers that are qualifying so far.</p>
                        <h3>26/08/24 - News Update</h3><p>The AGM for the forthcoming season was held at 7.30pm at the The North Star, 271 Hook Road, Chessington KT9 1EQ, on the 21 August 2024. You can read the minutes of the meeting in full by clicking <a href="agmminutes.html"><b>here</b></a>, however, below is a summary of the salient points that came from the meeting:</p>
                        <ul>
                           <li><p>We understand the Bowl will not be increasing the cost of each league game and therefore
remains at &pound;3.60 (&pound;10.80 per match). It was therefore proposed we keep our lineage at &pound;15.00.</p></li>
                           <li><p>Our league accounts show we have a very healthy bank balance of exactly £804.11, which will be carried over
to the 2024-2025 season.  This was in the main due to the Bowl not increasing the cost of each game as expected in January last season.</p></li>
                           <li><p>When a blind is used, Captains are responsible for the absent bowler’s prize fund. All the while we only pay the Bowl for the members actually bowling, this is set at the current league’s lineage minus the Bowl’s charge for the three league games (which currently equates to &pound;4.20).</p></li>
                           <li><p>A league member not bowling in a match may bowl as a pacer if another team has an absent bowler, but the pacer’s scores do not now count towards the result of the match. The team's absent bowler’s blind score must be used in the scores when determining the match result.</p></li>
                           <li><p>Pacers scores are now to be used to calculate the bowler’s league averages and count towards the league high scores, in addition to the individual league and other competition results. Therefore, the pacer must contribute towards the prize fund in full, meaning the full league lineage is due.</p></li>
                           <li><p>The Bowl’s charge for each team’s three league games is paid directly to the Bowl when a postponed match is played. The current prize fund contribution only is paid by the Captains to the Treasurer before the date of the postponed match.</p></li>
                           <li><p>To qualify for an individual award, a league member only now has to bowl in ten matches (30 games). This will ensure each member of a team with more than four bowlers has the opportunity to qualify for an individual prize.</p></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Our league constitution has been amended to reflect the above, but otherwise it remains the same as the previous season.</p>
                        <p>All that is now left for me to say is that we look forward to seeing you all again for yet another great season, in what must be one of the oldest, if not the oldest league's still running at Tolworth, on <b>Sunday 8 September 2024</b> at 9.25am.</p>
